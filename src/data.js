      message: "Beloved the Camp meeting is a holy convocation, where we meet, as God bestows upon us those rich spiritual blessings that we desire most. The call of God today is to a new life in Christ Jesus. We need to be born again. We need to return to our first love. Sin has deadened our sensibilities and seared our consciences. Our vision has become blurred, so that we can not see with true perspective. We have become so fascinated with the things of time and sense that the appeal of heaven has lost its power in our lives.",

The time in which we live is a time that needs endurance it's a time of intense excitement, Ambitions, wars, pleasures, heartbreaks, deaths and money-making, absorb the minds of men. But camp meeting is here to interrupt our thinking and summon our intellects to the throne of grace so that we may obtain mercy to use in the time of trouble. I invite you to pause all aspects of worldly activity and come join us as we seat at the feet of Jesus during our camp meeting 2025.",

This refers to the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the Lamb of God.

Come prepared to understand God's prophetic timeline and your place in it.",
